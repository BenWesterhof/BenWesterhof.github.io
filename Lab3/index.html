                 Hello and welcome to my introductory website. If you have made it here, then congradulations! You are on track to becoming the World's Greatest Supervillain! Just kidding, you probably just had the link... Anyways, it's nice to meet you! My name, of course, is Ben and I am currently a 5th year college student with no real talent and no direction in life. If you think this is sad, then look at what you are doing right now...You are actually reading this entire paragraph, like seriously? Don't you have anything bettter to do? Just look at the page and see if it looks good or not. Thanks!!
